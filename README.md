## Revive Edit Button on ChatGPT
A simple chrome extension for bringing back the edit button on ChatGPT.

### The story
I was in the middle of tweaking my [complexity calculator project](https://github.com/nikiljos/algo-complexity-calculator) when, as usual, I turned to ChatGPT for a little help. And, true to form, my terrible typing struck again. I went to fix the typos, but then—wait, where was the edit button? 🤨  

At first, I blamed my Mac. It has a habit of acting up at the worst times. So, I did the classic troubleshooting ritual: reloaded the page a million times, hoping it would magically reappear. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. 😩  

That’s when it hit me—maybe this wasn’t just my Mac being dramatic. A quick search led me to a [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ipsg5l/cant_edit_previous_prompts_now/) where others were freaking out about the same thing. Turns out, the button wasn’t gone; it was just hidden with some CSS trickery. 🎩✨  

I felt a surge of excitement. I popped open the browser console and whipped up a quick JavaScript fix to update the CSS and resurrect the button right where it belonged. Success! 🎉  

But then it hit me—not everyone’s comfortable with browser consoles or writing JavaScript on the fly. So, why not make this easier for everyone? That’s how the idea for my new browser extension was born. It automatically brings back the edit button for anyone missing it. I’ve already submitted it to the Chrome Store, and now I’m waiting for the review process to wrap up. ⏳  

Fingers crossed it gets published soon! 🤞  

> P.S. OpenAI, if you’re reading this, can you just bring back the edit button already? Please? 🙏
